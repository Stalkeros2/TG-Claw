<b>This is a Fallout 13 Server. Roleplay is expected and you should have basic knowledge of fallout lore.</b>

Don't be a dick, and <b>read the rules</b> before you play.

Development is active and we are always looking for more talent, we are open source and running a ported /tg/ version of legacy F13 code.
